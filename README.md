# rust-raytracer

A raytracer built using the [pixels](https://docs.rs/pixels/) crate, following along with Gabriel Gambetta's _Computer Graphics from Scratch_.

Controls: `WASD` to move around, `space` to go up and `lshift` to go down, arrow keys to look around. You may need to click inside the webpage first before the controls work. Try it out at [raytracer.bleebo.dev](https://raytracer.bleebo.dev/)!
